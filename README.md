6. Open `dotnet/resources` folder (if you can't find this folder, just create it)
7. Clone the repo to this folder
8. Build the project to obtain DLL.
9. Start `service-files/ragemp-server.exe`
10. Finally, connect to the 127.0.0.1:22005 via RAGE MP

## Possible Improvements / Challenges
Currently, all logic is written synchronously. To avoid blocking the main thread during long-running operations (such as database calls), the code should be refactored to use asynchronous approach. However, RAGE:MP has limitations regarding async code:
- Calling NAPI (e.g., modifying player state, sending messages) from non-main threads â€” such as within async methods or background tasks, can lead to undefined behavior and warnings.
- Asynchronous code running in background tasks can lead to race conditions if server state changes in the meantime.
